**Minimum iOS**: 13

## Features

## Unit Testing
I made sure to cover all view model business logic.

## Improvements
To make it better, using sdwebimage / kingfisher would increase the image loading performance especially in a CollectionView.
Implementing 3rd party network layer like Moya will also increase readability.
